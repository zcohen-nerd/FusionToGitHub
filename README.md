# Autodesk Fusion to GitHub Add-In

This Fusion 360 Add-In automatically exports your Autodesk Fusion designs and pushes them directly to a GitHub repository. Perfect for easy version control, automatic backups, and seamless collaboration.

## To Do

This list is prioritized to tackle features offering a good balance of user benefit and development effort first.

**Core Functionality & Enhancements**
* [ ] **Bill of Materials (BOM) Export**
    * Integrate BOM generation from the active Fusion 360 design and export it as a CSV or JSON file alongside the other design files. (currently having issues with this, may take a while)
* [ ] **Project Metadata Export**
    * Generate and optionally push a project metadata file (.json or .txt) with each commit (e.g., including details like export date/time, active document name, component count, or custom notes input by the user).
* [ ] **Parameter Export (JSON/CSV)**
    * Export key user parameters (model parameters, user parameters) from the active Fusion 360 design to a structured file (e.g., JSON, CSV) to be versioned.
* [ ] **Thumbnail/Image Export**
    * Automatically capture a thumbnail image (e.g., PNG) of the current view or a predefined isometric view of the model and include it in the commit for visual reference in Git history.
* [ ] **Git Flow Resilience Enhancements**
    * Restore the planned UI prompts (auto-stash confirmation, skip-pull toggle, branch preview/override, PAT credential storage) and per-repo export subfolder support.
* [ ] **Observability Controls**
    * Surface log-level selection, Fusion text palette mirroring, and a quick "View Log" action so diagnostics are accessible without editing code.
* [ ] **Pull Request Automation**
    * Add an option to automatically open a GitHub pull request after successfully pushing a new branch. This will require GitHub API interaction and handling a Personal Access Token (PAT).
* [ ] **Drawing Export (as first part of "Drawing / Electronics / Manufacturing Export")**
    * Enable the export of associated 2D drawing documents (e.g., as .dwg or .pdf).
* [ ] **Advanced Export Settings per Format**
    * For common formats like STL, STEP, etc., provide UI options to control more detailed export settings (e.g., STL mesh refinement levels, binary/ASCII; STEP protocol version).
* [ ] **UI/UX Improvement: Further Streamline Input Flow (e.g., pre-filling settings)**
    * Consider if, for existing repos, the settings fields (`exportFormatsConfig`, etc.) should pre-fill with the selected repo's current settings when chosen from the dropdown, likely requiring an `InputChangedEventHandler`.
* [ ] **Electronics Export (from Drawing / Electronics / Manufacturing Export)**
    * Add support for exporting schematics/PCB layouts (e.g., .sch, .brd).
* [ ] **Manufacturing Export (CAM Toolpaths) (from Drawing / Electronics / Manufacturing Export)**
    * Add support for exporting CAM toolpaths (e.g., .nc files).
* [ ] **File Versioning Improvements (Beyond Changelog)**
    * Explore options for managing versions of exported files beyond standard Git history if specific needs arise (e.g., integrating with Fusion's built-in versioning for exports).

## Installation and Setup Guide

### âœ… Step 1: Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

1.  **[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)** installed on your system and accessible via the command line.
2.  A **GitHub account**.
3.  **Python 3.9+** installed locally (only required if you plan to use the new offline CLI harness).

> ðŸ’¡ The add-in interacts with Git via the system CLI onlyâ€”no external Python packages are required. A `requirements.txt` file is bundled for tooling compatibility but intentionally left empty.

### âœ… Step 2: Install the Add-In

1.  **Download or Clone this Add-In:**
    * If you have this Add-In's files (e.g., from a ZIP download or by cloning its own repository if it's hosted on Git), locate the `Push_To_GitHub` folder. This folder should directly contain `Push_To_GitHub.py` and `Push_To_GitHub.manifest`.
2.  **Copy to Fusion 360 Add-Ins Directory:**
    * Copy the entire `Push_To_GitHub` folder into the Fusion 360 Add-Ins directory:
        * **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Autodesk\Autodesk Fusion 360\API\AddIns`
            (You can paste this path into your File Explorer address bar)
        * **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Autodesk/Autodesk Fusion 360/API/AddIns`
            (In Finder, click "Go" > "Go to Folder..." and paste this path)
3.  **Restart Fusion 360.**

### âœ… Step 3: Configure the Add-In Script (One-Time)

1.  **Git Executable Path (CRITICAL):**
    * Open the `Push_To_GitHub.py` file (located in the `API/AddIns/Push_To_GitHub` folder) with a text editor (like VS Code, Notepad++, etc.).
    * Near the top of the script, find this line:
        ```python
        os.environ['GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE'] = r"C:\\Program Files\\Git\\cmd\\git.exe"
        ```
    * **Modify the path** (the part in quotes, e.g., `r"C:\\Program Files\\Git\\cmd\\git.exe"`) to point to the exact location of `git.exe` on your system if it's different. Ensure you use double backslashes `\\` for paths on Windows or a raw string `r"..."`.
    * Even without GitPython, this environment variable helps Fusion locate the intended Git CLIâ€”handy when multiple Git installs exist on the same machine.
2.  **Configure Your Git Identity (if not already done globally):**
    * This tells Git who is making the commits. Open a Command Prompt or Terminal and run:
        ```cmd
        git config --global user.name "Your Name"
        git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
        ```
    Replace "Your Name" and "you@example.com" with your actual Git username and email.

### âœ… Step 4: Using the Add-In

1.  **Find the Button:** After restarting Fusion 360, the "Push to GitHub (ZAC)" button should appear in your Fusion 360 UI. It's typically added to a panel in the "UTILITIES" or "TOOLS" tab of the "DESIGN" workspace.
2.  **Open the Dialog:** Click the "Push to GitHub (ZAC)" button. A dialog box will appear with all options.
3.  **Adding a New Repository for the First Time:**
    * In the "Action / Select Repo" dropdown, choose `+ Add new GitHub repo...`.
    * Fill in the "New Repo Name" field (e.g., `MyFusionProject`). This name is used for the local folder and configuration.
    * Fill in the "Git URL (if adding)" field with the HTTPS or SSH URL of an **empty or existing repository** on GitHub (e.g., `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git`).
    * Configure the "Export Formats," "Default Commit Template," and "Branch Format" for this new repository.
    * Click "OK." The Add-In will clone the repository (if it's remote and doesn't exist locally in the Add-In's base directory) and save its configuration. You'll need to restart the command (re-click the button) to select this new repo for pushing.
4.  **Pushing to an Existing Configured Repository:**
    * In the "Action / Select Repo" dropdown, choose the name of the repository you want to push to.
    * The fields "Export Formats," "Default Commit Template," and "Branch Format" will be visible. **If you change any of these values, the stored configuration for the selected repository will be updated when you click "OK."**
    * Enter your desired "Commit Message (for this push)." Placeholders like `{filename}` will be replaced with the design's name.
    * Adjust the "Branch Format (config)" if you need a different branch naming convention. Tokens such as `{filename}` and `{timestamp}` are resolved automatically when you push.
    * Click "OK." The Add-In will:
        1.  Update the selected repository's settings in the configuration file (if you changed them in the dialog).
        2.  Export your active Fusion 360 design using the configured formats.
        3.  Commit the exported files to a new local branch.
        4.  Push the new branch to your GitHub repository.
        5.  A success message will indicate the branch name. You can then create a Pull Request on GitHub to merge the changes if desired.

### ï¿½ Git Flow Behavior

- Uncommitted local changes are auto-stashed (including untracked files) before the pull and restored afterward. If restoration fails, check `git stash list` for entries containing `fusion_git_addin_autostash`.
- A `git pull --rebase origin <current-branch>` runs before creating the export branch so your commit builds on the latest remote history.
- Branch names come from the configured template and are sanitized to remove unsupported characters.
- Each run prepends a new entry to `CHANGELOG.md` summarizing the branch, commit message, and exported files.
- Export warnings (for example, DXF without sketches) surface in the final summary dialog so you know what needs attention next time.

### ï¿½ðŸ§ª Offline CLI Harness

- `push_cli.py` lets you exercise the full Git pipeline (branch creation, changelog update, push) without launching Fusion. It's perfect for CI or smoke-testing repo configs.
- Requirements: Python 3.9+, Git on PATH, and a repo cloned locally. No extra pip packages are needed; `requirements.txt` remains empty by design.
- Typical usage:

```powershell
python push_cli.py --repo C:\path\to\repo --files exports/model.step exports/model.stl --design-name BracketV4
```

- Add `--assume-yes` to skip interactive prompts, `--branch-override` to force a branch name, and `--pat-token`/`--pat-username` to feed HTTPS credentials via the harness.
- The script prints a concise summary (branch name, whether force-push was required, stash activity) and exits non-zero on failure so you can wire it into automated checks.

## âœ… Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Add-In Not Appearing:**
    - Ensure Fusion 360 was restarted after copying the Add-In folder.
    - Double-check the installation path is correct.
    - Validate your `Push_To_GitHub.manifest` file using an online JSON validator. Ensure the `"script"` entry points to `Push_To_GitHub.py`.
- **Local changes silently stashed:**
    - The add-in auto-stashes local edits before pulling. If something looks off after the push, run `git status` and `git stash list`; you can re-apply the entry named `fusion_git_addin_autostash` manually if needed.
- **Where do logs live?**
    - A rotating log file is written to `%APPDATA%/.PushToGitHub_AddIn_Data/PushToGitHub.log` on Windows or `~/.PushToGitHub_AddIn_Data/PushToGitHub.log` on macOS. Open it with your editor if you need deeper diagnostics.
- **"Git executable not found" or "Bad Git executable":**
    - Verify the path set for `os.environ['GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE']` inside the `Push_To_GitHub.py` script is correct and points directly to your `git.exe` (on Windows) or `git` (on macOS/Linux).
    - Ensure Git is installed and its command-line tools are working.
- **Git Push/Pull Errors (e.g., "No upstream branch," authentication failed):**
    - These are often general Git issues. Ensure your local repository is correctly configured to communicate with the remote on GitHub (authentication, correct remote URL). For first-time pushes to a new branch from a local repo, Git sometimes requires `git push -u origin <branchname>`. The script attempts to handle this with `--set-upstream`. If authentication fails, ensure your Git client is configured to authenticate with GitHub (e.g., using a PAT, SSH key).
