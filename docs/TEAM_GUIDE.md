## ðŸ‘¥ Team Setup Guide

### For Team Leaders

#### 1. Create Team Repository
```bash
# Create new GitHub repository
# Name: project-designs (or your project name)
# Type: Private (recommended for proprietary designs)
# Initialize with README
```

**Repository Settings**:
- **Visibility**: Private for proprietary work, Public for open source
- **Branch Protection**: Enable for main/master branch
- **Required Reviews**: Recommended for important projects

#### 2. Add Team Members
1. **Repository Settings** â†’ **Manage access**
2. **Invite collaborators** with appropriate permissions:
   - **Admin**: Team leads, project managers
   - **Write**: Design engineers, contributors
   - **Read**: Reviewers, stakeholders

#### 3. Establish Team Conventions

**Branch Naming Convention**:
```
features/{designer-name}/{design-name}-{timestamp}
releases/v{version-number}
experiments/{designer-name}/{description}
hotfixes/{issue-description}
```

**Commit Message Standards**:
```
[DESIGN] Updated bracket with reinforcement ribs
[FIX] Corrected clearance issue in assembly
[NEW] Added mounting holes to base plate
[DOC] Updated design specifications
```

### For Team Members

#### 1. Install and Configure
1. **Follow installation guide** (`INSTALLATION.md`)
2. **Configure team repository**:
   - Use shared GitHub repository URL
   - Set up local workspace folder
   - Store Personal Access Token

#### 2. Configure Team Settings
```
Branch Template: features/{your-name}/{filename}-{timestamp}
Export Subfolder: designs/{your-name}/
Commit Message: [Your prefix] Descriptive message
```

## ðŸ”„ Team Workflows

### Workflow 1: Feature Branch Development

**Best for**: Individual design work with team review

```
1. Designer creates feature branch
   â””â”€â”€ features/alice/bracket-v2-20250930-143022

2. Designer exports multiple iterations
   â”œâ”€â”€ Initial design
   â”œâ”€â”€ Refinements
   â””â”€â”€ Final version

3. Designer creates Pull Request
   â””â”€â”€ "New bracket design with improved strength"

4. Team reviews changes
   â”œâ”€â”€ Design review
   â”œâ”€â”€ Engineering feedback
   â””â”€â”€ Approval/changes requested

5. Merge to main branch
   â””â”€â”€ Design becomes part of project
```

**Add-in Configuration**:
- **Branch Template**: `features/{your-name}/{filename}-{timestamp}`
- **Commit Messages**: Descriptive with your initials
- **Export Format**: F3D for full design data + STEP for CAD sharing

### Workflow 2: Release Management

**Best for**: Formal design releases and versioning

```
1. Prepare release branch
   â””â”€â”€ releases/v1.0

2. Export final designs
   â”œâ”€â”€ All production formats
   â”œâ”€â”€ Documentation
   â””â”€â”€ Assembly files

3. Tag release on GitHub
   â””â”€â”€ v1.0 with release notes

4. Distribute to stakeholders
   â””â”€â”€ Download release assets
```

**Add-in Configuration**:
- **Branch Template**: `releases/v{timestamp}` or `releases/v1.0`
- **Export Multiple Formats**: F3D, STEP, STL, PDF
- **Include Changelog**: Full design history

### Workflow 3: Parallel Development

**Best for**: Multiple designers working simultaneously

```
Designer A: features/alice/housing-{timestamp}
Designer B: features/bob/internals-{timestamp}
Designer C: features/carol/mounting-{timestamp}

Regular sync meetings to:
â”œâ”€â”€ Review progress
â”œâ”€â”€ Resolve design conflicts
â”œâ”€â”€ Coordinate interfaces
â””â”€â”€ Plan integration
```

**Coordination Strategy**:
- **Daily standups**: Discuss design progress
- **Interface agreements**: Coordinate design interfaces
- **Regular merges**: Integrate changes frequently
- **Design reviews**: Formal review process

## ðŸ”€ Advanced Team Features

### Branch Management

#### Branch Types
```bash
# Feature development
features/{designer}/{description}

# Bug fixes
fixes/{designer}/{issue-description}

# Experiments
experiments/{designer}/{concept}

# Releases
releases/v{major}.{minor}

# Hotfixes
hotfixes/{urgent-fix-description}
```

#### Branch Lifecycle
1. **Create**: Designer starts new feature
2. **Develop**: Multiple commits during design process
3. **Review**: Team reviews via Pull Request
4. **Integrate**: Merge to main after approval
5. **Cleanup**: Delete feature branch after merge

### Pull Request Workflow

#### Creating Pull Requests
1. **Export design** to feature branch
2. **Go to GitHub repository**
3. **Create Pull Request**:
   - **Title**: Brief description
   - **Description**: Detailed changes
   - **Reviewers**: Assign team members
   - **Labels**: Use project labels

#### Review Process
**Reviewers check**:
- Design quality and completeness
- File formats and organization
- Commit message quality
- Design documentation
- Compliance with standards

**Review outcomes**:
- âœ… **Approve**: Design ready to merge
- ðŸ”„ **Request Changes**: Needs modifications
- ðŸ’¬ **Comment**: General feedback

### Conflict Resolution

#### Design Conflicts
When multiple designers modify related files:

1. **Identify conflicts**: Git will flag conflicting files
2. **Coordinate resolution**: Designers discuss changes
3. **Manual merge**: Combine changes in Fusion 360
4. **Re-export**: Export merged design
5. **Commit resolution**: Mark conflicts as resolved

#### Prevention Strategies
- **Clear ownership**: Assign design areas to specific designers
- **Regular communication**: Daily updates on progress
- **Interface coordination**: Agree on design interfaces early
- **Frequent integration**: Merge changes regularly

## ðŸ“Š Team Dashboard and Monitoring

### GitHub Repository Insights

**Track team activity**:
- **Insights** â†’ **Pulse**: Recent activity summary
- **Contributors**: Individual team member contributions
- **Code frequency**: Design activity over time
- **Network**: Branch and merge visualization

### Project Management Integration

#### GitHub Projects

4. **Track progress**

#### Issue Tracking
```bash
# Design issues
"[DESIGN] Clearance problem in assembly"
"[REVIEW] Need structural analysis for bracket"
"[SPEC] Update mounting hole specifications"

# Process issues
"[PROCESS] Standardize export formats"
"[TOOL] Update add-in to latest version"
```

#### Best Practices
- **Private repositories** for proprietary designs
- **Signed commits** for authenticity
- **Access logging** via GitHub audit logs
- **Regular access reviews** to remove former team members

#### Data Loss Prevention
- **Backup strategy**: Multiple repository clones
